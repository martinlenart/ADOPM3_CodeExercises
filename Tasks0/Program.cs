// Exercises
//1. Create and start a Task t1 that loops 5 times and in each loop prints out "Hello{i} from Thread1" and sleeps 2 second
//2. Create and start a Task t2 that loops 10 times and in each loop prints out "Hello{i} from Thread2" and sleeps 1 second
//3. Create and start a Task t3 that loops 15 times and in each loop prints out "Hello{i} from Thread3" and sleeps 0,5 second
//4. Change the order of execution using t1.Wait() so that t2 and t3 starts after t1 has completed execution
//5. Experiment by changig the t1/t2/t3.Wait() and see what happends
